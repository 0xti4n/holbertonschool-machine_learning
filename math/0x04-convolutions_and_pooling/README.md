# Convolutions and Pooling

## Specializations - Machine Learning ― Math.

## Description

* This repository contains some basic Convolutions and Pooling exercises

## Learning Objectives

**Understand:**


* What is a convolution?
* What is max pooling? average pooling?
* What is a kernel/filter?
* What is padding?
* What is “same” padding? “valid” padding?
* What is a stride?
* What are channels?
* How to perform a convolution over an image
* How to perform max/average pooling over an image

## Dependencies
```
Python 3.5
numpy 1.15
```
