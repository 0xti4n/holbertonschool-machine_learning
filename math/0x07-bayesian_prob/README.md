## Repo content

* **Main Folder that contains all main of the following tasks:**

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**0. Likelihood** | calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
|**1. Intersection** | calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various hypothetical probabilities:
|**2. Marginal Probability** | calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data:
|**3. Posterior** | calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data
|**4. Continuous Posterior** | calculates the posterior probability that the probability of developing severe side effects falls within a specific range given the data
