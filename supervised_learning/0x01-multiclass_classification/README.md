## Repo content

* **Main Folder that contains all main of the following tasks:**

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**0. One-Hot Encode** | converts a numeric label vector into a one-hot matrix
|**1. One-Hot Decode** | converts a one-hot matrix into a vector of labels:
|**2. Persistence is Key** | Saves the instance object to a file in pickle format
|**3. Update DeepNeuralNetwork** | Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork to perform multiclass classification
|**4. All the Activations** | Update the class DeepNeuralNetwork to allow different activation functions

## Usage
