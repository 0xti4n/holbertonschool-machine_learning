# Tensorflow

## Specializations - Machine Learning â€• Supervised Learning

## Description

* This repository contains some Tensorflow exercises
* Please download these datasets (Binary_Train.npz, Binary_Dev.npz, MNIST.npz) to test all tasks

## Learning Objectives

**Understand:**

* What is tensorflow?
* What is a session? graph?
* What are tensors?
* What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
* What are operations? How do you use them?
* What are namespaces? How do you use them?
* How to train a neural network in tensorflow
* What is a checkpoint?
* How to save/load a model with tensorflow
* What is the graph collection?
* How to add and get variables from the collection

## Dependencies
```
Python 3.5
numpy 1.15
tensorflow 1.12
```

## Repo content

* **Main Folder that contains all main of the following tasks:**

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**0. Placeholders** | returns two placeholders, x and y, for the neural network
|**1. Layers** | create layer
|**2. Forward Propagation** | creates the forward propagation graph for the neural network
|**3. Accuracy** | calculates the accuracy of a prediction
|**4. Loss** |  calculates the softmax cross-entropy loss of a prediction
