* What is singular value decomposition?
* What is the difference between eig and svd?
* What is dimensionality reduction and what are its purposes?
* What is principal components analysis (PCA)?
* What is t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)?
* What is a manifold?
* What is the difference between linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction?
* Which techniques are linear/non-linear?
