## Specializations - Machine Learning â€• The Pipeline 

## Description

* This repository contains Pandas exercises

## Learning Objectives

**Understand:**

* What is pandas?
* What is a pd.DataFrame? How do you create one?
* What is a pd.Series? How do you create one?
* How to load data from a file
* How to perform indexing on a pd.DataFrame
* How to use hierarchical indexing with a pd.DataFrame
* How to slice a pd.DataFrame
* How to reassign columns
* How to sort a pd.DataFrame
* How to use boolean logic with a pd.DataFrame
* How to merge/concatenate/join pd.DataFrames
* How to get statistical information from a pd.DataFrame
* How to visualize a pd.DataFrame

## Dependencies
```
Python 3.5
numpy 1.15
pandas (version 0.24)
```

## Repo content
* A folder named **main** that contain main files of the following tasks:

| Task | Description |
| --- | --- |
|**0. From Numpy**| creates a pd.DataFrame from a np.ndarray
|**1. From Dictionary**| created a pd.DataFrame from a dictionary
|**2. From File**| loads data from a file as a pd.DataFrame
|**3. Rename**| Complete the script
|**4. To Numpy**| Complete the script and take the last 10 rows of the columns High and Close and convert them into a numpy.ndarray
|**5. Slice**| Complete the script to slice the pd.DataFrame along the columns High, Low, Close, and Volume_BTC, taking every 60th row
|**6. Flip it and Switch it**| Complete the script to alter the pd.DataFrame such that the rows and columns are transposed and the data is sorted in reverse chronological order
|**7. Sort**| Complete the script to sort the pd.DataFrame by the High price in descending order
|**8. Prune**| Complete the script to remove the entries in the pd.DataFrame where Close is NaN
|**9. Fill**| Complete the script to fill in the missing data points in the pd.DataFrame
|**10. Indexing**| Complete the script to index the pd.DataFrame on the Timestamp column
|**11. Concat**| Complete the script to index the pd.DataFrames on the Timestamp columns and concatenate them
|**12. Hierarchy**| Based on 11-concat, rearrange the MultiIndex levels such that timestamp is the first level
|**13. Analyze**| Complete the script to calculate descriptive statistics for all columns in pd.DataFrame except Timestamp
|**14. Visualize**| Complete the script to visualize the pd.DataFrame

## Usage
* Clone the repo and execute the main files
